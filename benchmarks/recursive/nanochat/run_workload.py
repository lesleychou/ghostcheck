Fixed per-app run_workload for the recursive nanochat app.

Runs ONE workload of a program (P = initial_program, P' = best_program) across
N_SEEDS training subprocesses and returns the SEED-AVERAGED metrics for the
GhostCheck oracle. Averaging is the fix for single-run noise: nanochat training is
stochastic and wall-clock-budgeted, so a single (program, workload) run is noisy
enough to produce false optimality witnesses. We compare means instead.

Seed policy (controls cost):
  n_seeds = workload["n_seeds"]  (if agent2 injected one)  else
            $GHOSTCHECK_SCREEN_SEEDS                        else  3
  The orchestrator screens at 3; on a flagged regression agent2 re-runs the same
  workload with n_seeds = --confirm-seeds (e.g. 5) and keeps the witness only if
  it reproduces. The coverage-only run is forced to n_seeds=1 (its output is unused
  by the oracle), so a screened workload costs ~ 1 + 3 + 3 trainings.

Why a subprocess (not in-process): the program files are IMPORT-SAFE (their train
block is guarded behind `if __name__ == "__main__" or GHOSTCHECK_RUN==1`), so the
harness can import them to get `program_module.__file__` WITHOUT training. We then
launch that same file as a fresh subprocess with GHOSTCHECK_RUN=1 to actually train.
A fresh interpreter per call is the only CUDA-safe option (the scripts hold
torch.compile + CUDA state and the harness forks its worker). PR_SET_PDEATHSIG ties
each training child's lifetime to the harness worker so a harness SIGKILL (timeout)
can't leak an orphaned GPU process.

Root-cause: on a crash we re-raise with the child's FULL traceback (its last lines
name the real file:line, e.g. best_program.py:319 `_decorr_bigram_primes[j]`
IndexError). The harness captures that in result["error"]/["traceback"], Agent 2
stores it on the matrix entry, and Agent 3 root-causes from it — no coverage needed.

IMPORTANT: the harness timeout (run_all_app --timeout) must cover ALL n_seeds
trainings in one call, since they run serially here.

Workload params (JSON-serializable scalars; Agent 1 infers ranges from evaluator.py).
P and P' MUST receive the same workload so the differential is fair:
  seed              int   base RNG seed; seeds used are base..base+n_seeds-1  [true input]
  seq_len           int   sequence length (<= 2048)                          [true input]
  time_budget       int   per-seed training seconds (small = cheap proxy)
  depth             int   transformer layers (n_layer)      [config-robustness probe]
  device_batch_size int   per-step batch                    [config-robustness probe]
NOTE: depth/device_batch_size are program *config*, not true inputs — varying them
tests config-robustness (does P' generalize beyond the regime it was tuned for).

Returned metrics. The optimality oracle is HIGHER-IS-BETTER and only scores
int/float fields, so we expose exactly ONE numeric field for it:
  neg_val_bpb = -mean(val_bpb over seeds) -> fires only when P' mean bpb is WORSE
                                             (higher) than P -> a real regression.
Everything else is a STRING (ignored by the oracle, kept for the report): per-seed
bpb, std (noise gauge), step count, peak VRAM. Dropped as numeric oracle fields:
peak_vram_mb (P' is constantly heavier -> would fire on every workload; OOM ->
correctness instead) and num_steps (cross-architecture step counts aren't a clean
regression). A crash / CUDA-OOM / no-output run RAISES -> correctness flags it.
Success is keyed on the printed "val_bpb:" line, NOT the exit code (the scripts can
exit non-zero from a benign native-threadpool teardown abort after printing).
