"""
Evaluator spec for the recursive nanochat app (read by Agent 1 to infer the
workload grammar). DESCRIPTIVE only — GhostCheck runs programs via run_workload.py,
which launches the training script as a subprocess. Grammar names/ranges below
must match run_workload.py's `workload.get(...)` keys.

Differential setup:
  P  = initial_program.py             -> recursive/vanilla_transformer.py
  P' = best/recursive/best_program.py -> recursive/optimized_from_karpathy.py
Each is trained for `time_budget` seconds on a fixed FineWeb-style dataset and
scored by validation bits-per-byte (lower is better). The SAME workload is run
for both; the oracle flags workloads where P' regresses.

WHAT "WORKLOAD" MEANS HERE (important framing):
  These programs are whole training scripts, so some knobs are program *config*,
  not data *inputs*. The study is therefore a CONFIG-ROBUSTNESS probe: does the
  AI-evolved P' still hold up when moved off the single regime it was tuned for
  (depth 8, B200, 5-min budget)?
    - TRUE INPUTS (closest to ADRS "workload"): seed, seq_len.
    - CONFIG-GENERALIZATION knobs: depth, device_batch_size. Sweeping these is the
      point — they expose P''s baked-in assumptions (e.g. depth-coupled per-layer
      tables) — but a quality (bpb) gap at an off-config point is a config-
      robustness regression, not an input-workload regression.

Regression types GhostCheck should find:
  - correctness : P' crashes/times-out where P succeeds (e.g. depth-coupled index
                  errors at large depth).
  - optimality  : P' produces WORSE val_bpb than P on some config (neg_val_bpb).
  (scalab_time / scalab_mem are NOT used for this app: training is wall-clock
   budgeted so total time is ~constant, and harness tracemalloc can't see GPU
   memory — those regressions surface as fewer steps / OOM -> correctness.)
