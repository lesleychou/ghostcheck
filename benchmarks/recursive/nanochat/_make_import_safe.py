"""
Transform a canonical (train-on-import) nanochat source into an IMPORT-SAFE,
self-contained program file that GhostCheck can import without training and run
as a subprocess.

Two edits, both string-marker based (no hardcoded line numbers):
  1. Drop the dead flash-attn-4 custom-op block (`cap = get_device_capability()`
     .. up to `from lib import`). The SDPA override right after `from lib import`
     already replaces flash_attn_func, so the FA4 block is dead code AND the only
     thing that inits CUDA at import — removing it makes the harness import cheap.
  2. Guard the train tail (`t_start = time.time()` .. EOF) behind
     `if __name__ == "__main__" or os.environ.get("GHOSTCHECK_RUN") == "1":` so the
     harness can import the module (defs only) without training. run_workload runs
     the file as a subprocess with GHOSTCHECK_RUN=1 to actually train.

Usage: python _make_import_safe.py <src.py> <dst.py>
